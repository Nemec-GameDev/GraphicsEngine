An graphical engine built from the ground up with the aid of Bootstrap

Author: Jonathan Nemec

INFO
----------------------------
Both of the files have been zipped/compressed using '7zip'. If you are struggling
to unconpress the files, please use '7zip'.

Code is written in C++

There's no build as the build on its own will not run (for me at least). There is
no compile errors and the engine can be "built" from the source code, but when
attempting to run seperatly the application just closes.

Installation
----------------------------
Source Code
  1) Unzipe the file
  2) Find "Bootstrap.sln" and open it
  3) Done

Use
----------------------------
Source Code:
Once in "Bootstrap.sln" you can build it via the "Local Windows Debugger" button.
All source code that is not 'Bootstrap' can be found under the "Project3D" project in
the 'Solution Explorer'.
